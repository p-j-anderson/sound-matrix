# Sound Matrix
A Sound Matrix is a series of squares that, if enabled, play sounds as the beat loops. An introduction to creating your own sound matrix can be found in my blog [post](https://medium.com/@panderson.dev/creating-a-sound-matrix-81d1b48513ae). This project expands upon the intro post and is a fully functional matrix with customizable visuals and scales.

## Generating Sounds
Sounds were generated and compiled by me using [Logix Pro X](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) and [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
